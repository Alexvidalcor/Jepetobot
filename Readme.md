_Telegram bot developed to explore the AI possibilities of OpenAI._

_Support for deployment on AWS is included through Github Actions._


## Main features :fire:


### AWS cloud deployment support.

* IaC (Infrastructure as Code) support for cloud infrastructure on Amazon Web Services is included through the <ins>AWS CDK</ins>.

* Support for local execution is also included.


### Automated deployment of cloud infrastructure and code.

* The deployment of cloud infrastructure on AWS has been automated through <ins>Github Actions</ins>.

* New code releases have also been automated via github actions and <ins>Docker containers</ins>.


### Easy access to ChatGPT (GPT3.5-turbo) from Telegram

Adapted to the latest chatgpt model | 'Identity' change from bot options | 'Temperature' change from bot options

### Management system of users

* A system has been added to enable or deny access to specific user IDs

* The user management system can also be applied to the configuration access.


## Getting started üöÄ


### Debian-based/Fedora Linux distribution 

_Manual Installation (terminal commands):_

```
git clone https://github.com/Alexvidalcor/jepetobot
cd jepetobot/
python3 src/installation/install.py
./src/installation/execute.sh
```

_Installation using Docker (it is required to have Docker installed previously):_

```
git clone https://github.com/Alexvidalcor/jepetobot
cd jepetobot/
docker build -t jepetobot . 
docker run -d -it --name jepetobot_cont jepetobot
```

### Get Telegram Token

It is necessary to obtain a token from the Telegram Bot API.

Instructions for it are [HERE](https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot).


### Get OpenAI Token

Instructions for it are [HERE](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction/tokens).



## Cloud Deployment üì¶


**Manual deploy in AWS:**

Need to have CDK pre-installed (Click [here](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/guides/setup-cdk/) for more information). 

Once CDK is installed and configured, run the following commands:

```
cdk synth

cdk deploy --all
```


**Automatic deploy in AWS via Github Actions:**

Currently there are two Github Actions workflows prepared to automate the deployment:


* _[cdk_deploy_resources.yaml](https://github.com/Alexvidalcor/jepetobot/blob/master/.github/workflows/cdk_deploy_resources.yaml)_

Resources | EC2 | S3| secretmanager | codedeploy |
--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |
Purpose | Machine where the application is hosted | Bucket where application versions are stored | Secret Manager inside AWS | Automates the deployment of new versions of the application | 


* _[update_application.yaml](https://github.com/Alexvidalcor/jepetobot/blob/master/.github/workflows/update_application.yaml)_

Update cloud app code with every push to master branch. It generates a slight service downtime of a few seconds.

| :zap:        All use of cloud generates costs, use it at your own risk!   |
