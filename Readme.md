_Telegram bot developed to explore the AI possibilities of OpenAI_

_Support for deployment on AWS is included through Github Actions_


## Getting started üöÄ


### Debian-based/Fedora Linux distribution 

_Manual Installation (terminal commands):_

```
git clone https://github.com/Alexvidalcor/jepetobot
cd jepetobot/
python3 src/installation/install.py
./src/installation/execute.sh
```

_Installation using Docker (it is required to have Docker installed previously):_

cd jepetobot/
docker build -t jepetobot . 
docker run -d -it --name jepetobot_cont jepetobot
```

## Cloud Deployment üì¶

**Manual deploy in AWS:**

Need to have CDK pre-installed (Click [here](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/guides/setup-cdk/) for more information). 

Once CDK is installed and configured, run the following commands:

```
cdk synth

cdk deploy --all
```

**Automatic deploy in AWS via Github Actions:**

Currently there are two Github Actions workflows prepared to automate the deployment:

* _cdk_deploy_resources.yaml_

Resources | EC2 | S3| secretmanager | codedeploy |
--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |
Purpose | Machine where the application is hosted | Bucket where application versions are stored | Secret Manager inside AWS | Automates the deployment of new versions of the application | 

* _update_application.yaml_

Update cloud app code with every push to master branch. It generates a slight service downtime of a few seconds.

| :zap:        All use of cloud generates costs, use it at your own risk!   |
